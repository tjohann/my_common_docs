Notes regarding voltage level (5/3,3)
-------------------------------------

Some displays also work with 3.3V, but you can use it with 5V as long as you make shure the display is in READ-ONLY mode! 3.3V is within the TTL level area for high/one ... So to make shure only reading is possible you have to hard wire the RW pin to ground!
