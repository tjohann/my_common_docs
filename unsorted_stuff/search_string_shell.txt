LIST="some string with a substring you want to match"
SOURCE="substring"
if echo "$LIST" | grep -q "$SOURCE"; then
  echo "matched";
else
  echo "no match";
fi




	

You can also compare with wildcards:

if [[ $LIST == *$SOURCE* ]]








You can use "index" if you only want to find a single character, e.g.:

LIST="server1 server2 server3 server4 server5"
SOURCE="3"
if expr index "$LIST" "$SOURCE"; then
    echo "match"
    exit -1
else
    echo "no match"
fi

Output is:

23
match
