commands
--------

ulimut -Hn -> for hard limits ... normally 4096
ulimut -Sn -> for soft limits ... normally 1024


cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max -> total max number of open files ... 3268774


changes
-------

/etc/sysctl.conf -> change file-max (not needed)
fs.file-max=what_ever_you_want

/etc/security/limits.conf -> change hard/soft limit via pam

for example in add file /etc/security/limits.d/20-softlimit-tjohann.conf with the following content:

# Increase number of openfiles for group users to 4096
@users soft nofile 4096

-> means all in group users will have a soft limit for open files or 4096
