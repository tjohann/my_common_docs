#
# short note about the difference of exit and return
#

# --- difference

- return is an language statement
- exit() is a syscall (not 100% correct -> exit() is libc function ... but result is the same)

If return is in the main function, then return and exit are nearly the same:

 * result with return (only relevant parts):

main:
.LFB10:
	.cfi_startproc
	movl	$0, %eax
	ret
	.cfi_endproc

 *
 * result with exit() (only relevant parts):

main:
.LFB10:
	.cfi_startproc
	subq	$8, %rsp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	movl	$0, %edi
	call	exit
	.cfi_endproc
