#

# --- PCF8574 summary
- the PCF8574 is a general purpose I2C 8-bit input/output port expander ... with this chip you can drive leds or read buttons ...
- the chip has an interrupt line (low after any change on input pins) ... after reading out the state of the pins, the interrupt line goes to high
- INT line is an open-drain output -> need 10k pullup ...
- I2C need 10k or 4k7 (if its the only device) pullup ...
- P0...P7 are open collector ports
  - 25mA to ground

  - Sum(P0...P7) < 200mA
  - to drive addtional logic use a 74HC04N or similiar
