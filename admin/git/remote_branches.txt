#
# some "defines"
#

- local branch
git branch my_branch  <- local branch ... only seen by me

- local tracking branch
git pull origin/master <- local "copy" (master) of a remote branch (origin/master)
                          here: pull from remote branch origin/master into
			        my local branch master
of simply
git pull  <- When local branches are trackin branches git knows where to pull/push,
    	     otherwise you get an error and habe to say which remote/branch



- remote (use git collaboratively -> github for example)
  * every machine or location is called remote

  see remote branches:
  git remote

  locations of remote branches:
  git remote -v

  every remote has a dir under git/ref/remotes:

  tjohann@barney:~/my_common_docs$ lf .git/refs/remotes/
  insgesamt 0
  drwxr-xr-x 3 tjohann tjohann 20  6. Aug 19:55 ./

- non-tracking branches
  git branch my_branch

- tracking branches
  Tracking local branches are "connected" with other branches (with local or remote)
  git branch --track my_branch [origin/master]
      	     	     	 |            |
		my branch name    the start point of remote branch

  view tracking branches
  git branch -vv

  or in .git/config
  [core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
  [remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/tjohann/my_common_docs
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
  [branch "master"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/master

- remote branches (on local machine)



#
# branches of a forked github repo
#

# create my_branch
git checkout -b my_branch

# push it on github
git push origin my_branch


#
# branch from a github branch to contiue work on another computer
#
# remote branch is arietta and your local branch is also named arietta
git checkout -b arietta remotes/origin/arietta

# set correct upstream
git remote add upstream git://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages.git
# pull from upstream
git pull upstream master

# pull from remote branch
git pull origin arietta

# push to remote branch
git push origin arietta
