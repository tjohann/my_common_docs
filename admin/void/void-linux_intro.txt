# a small void-linux intro
#

Void linux is a Linux-Distribution with special and unique features:

-> not a fork (complete new!)
-> rolling release (so always actual)
   + no big update cycles or new installations needed
   + always uptodate
   + no dependency hell due to old packages
   - could sometimes lead to temporary "brocken" system
     - if not all updates are in the repo!
     - only temporary -> one hour later or so erverthing is fine again!
-> use libressl instead of openssl
   + openssl is developed by one (!) person
   + lot of old code in openssl due to ancient platforms
   + libressl is maintained by the openbsd community
   + libressl starts with a cleanup!
-> xbps (X Binary Package System)
   + not a fork
   + extremly fast
   + unix like
     - xbps-install
     - xbps-remove
     - ...
   + scriptable
   + only runtime + lib + debug packages
-> xbps-src (package builder)
   + use namespaces
     - reproduceable build
     - clean environment with no dependencys to the host
   + easy template mechanism
   + a lot of pre-defined build schemes
     - one line to tell xbps-src to use "autotools" or ...
   + a lot of pre-defined download locations
   + a lot of pre-defined env-vars
     - makes it easy to read other templates
   + ready to use musl!
   + EASY crossbuild of a whole system or single packages
     - it holds was debian promise!
-> support for musl as libc replacement
-> ruint as really powerful init system
   + systemd free
   + fast
   + unix like
   + small
   + easy to understand!
   + easy to admin!
