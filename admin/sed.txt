#
# --- replace string ---
# Note:
#    -type f  --> file is of type: regular file
#    -exec command {} +  --> the command line is built by appending each selected file name at the end ... the total number of invocations of the command will be much less than the number of matched files ... so not so expensive

find <mydir> -type f -exec sed -i 's/<string1>/<string2>/g' {} +
