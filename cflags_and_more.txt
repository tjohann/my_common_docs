CFLAGS, AM_CFLAGS, and myprog_CFLAGS
====================================

CFLAGS is the user variable
AM_CFLAGS is the automake variable
myprog_CFLAGS is the variable specific to the myprog target

-> Automake always uses two of these variables when compiling C sources files.
   - myprog_CPPFLAGS if it is defined, or AM_CFLAGS otherwise
   - the second variable is always CFLAGS.

-> $(myprog_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)
-> $(AM_CFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)

-> why is $(CFLAGS) always at the end? Because so user can clear all others!
